Welcome! I am now a third-year PhD student at the [VLC group, University of Southampton](https://www.vlc.ecs.soton.ac.uk/). My current research is on Computer Vision and its Applications, particularly multi-modal material segmentation and panoramic depth estimation for immersive sound rendering, perception in autonomous driving (with a focus on sensor-fusion solutions), and the caption-based image retrieval method for data mining and corner-case generation. **For potential recruiters, I am thrilled to share that I have been approved to attend the viva for my PhD graduation on August 21. I am now seeking a research position in China, the UK, or any other European country.**

I received the MSc degree in Data Science and BEng degree in Electronics and Electrical Engineering from the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk), the BEng degree in Electrical Engineering and its Automation from the [North China Electric Power University](https://www.ncepu.edu.cn/).

During my doctoral research, I have emerged as a skilled and innovative individual researcher. My contributions in dense material segmentation have led to the proposal of three novel research advancements, including a pioneering multi-modal architecture that aligns hyperspectral images captured by hyperspectral cameras with spectral profiles measured by a spectrometer. I take great pride in having published two conference papers as the first author, with another currently submitted and under review. Additionally, I have extended the contributions of my conference papers, submitting them to major computer vision journals for further dissemination and academic impact.

Moreover, my experience extends beyond academia, as I have had the opportunity to work at a giant company during my two-year internship at Baidu. My primary focus was developing perception algorithms for autonomous driving scenarios, emphasising lidar-image fused 3D detection and caption-based image retrieval. Through this experience, I have become intimately familiar with multi-modal network architectures and realised that the key to utilising multi-modal information effectively lies in aligning diverse measurements properly to reduce uncertainty and exploit the full potential of the data.

In addition to my individual research pursuits, I am adept at working collaboratively as part of a team. I have successfully collaborated with fellow researchers, leading to the publication of three conference papers as a co-author. Furthermore, my time at Baidu saw me being entrusted with the role of team leader, guiding two PhD students and 19 master students in research endeavours and facilitating the deployment of algorithms on cloud platforms.
