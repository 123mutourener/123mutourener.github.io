Welcome! I am now a third-year PhD student at the [VLC group, University of Southampton](https://www.vlc.ecs.soton.ac.uk/). My current research is Computer Vision and its Applications, including material segmentation for immersive-sound rendering, vision-based autonomous driving, and panorama depth estimation.

I received the MSc degree in Data Science and BEng degree in Electronics and Electrical Engineering from the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk), the BEng degree in Electrical Engineering and its Automation from the [North China Electric Power University](https://www.ncepu.edu.cn/).
